Welcome to schedule generator!

If you're reading this, you don't know how to use
this software or you want to know how to run 
succesfully. So here is the usage:

schedule_generator SCHEDULE_FILE

Here is a schedule file example (With level,team and city):

1:Palmeiras:S達o Paulo
1:S達o Paulo:S達o Paulo
1:Corinthians:S達o Paulo
1:Santos:Santos
1:Barueri:Barueri

Please, do not forget the ":". They are really important
for the parser. Team names and city names can be so strange
and it is a really made my work easily.

Another error that made you read this is an erroneous 
schedule_file. So please watch carefully.

If you like this program, please send me a postcard!
